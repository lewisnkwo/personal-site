My first time in Vietnam began in Ho Chi Minh City this October - the city with the largest population of the country. I went there mainly to experience it's popular food such as 'Com Tam' (meaning Broken Rice) & 'Bun Thit Nuong' (a style of pork noodle bowl), and to also find out about it's attractions & it's popular nightlife.

### Why is it called Ho Chi Minh City instead of Saigon?

Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the official name of the largest city in Vietnam, formerly known as Saigon. The city was renamed in 1976 after 'Ho Chi Minh', the revolutionary leader who played a key role in the country's struggle for independence from the French colonial rule and later against the United States during the Vietnam War.

While Ho Chi Minh City is still used officially, I learnt during my visit that many locals and visitors still use the historic name "Saigon" commonly. Here are 5 other tips and experiences that I found very interesting during my 4-day stay in this amazing & bustling city:

### 1. Getting Around on Motorbike

When exploring Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), consider embracing the local experience by opting for a motorbike ride (I used Grab Motorbike) instead of relying on Grab cars or traditional taxis. Not only does this provide a cost-effective means of transportation, but it also allows you to weave through the vibrant streets and witness the city's bustling energy up close. One highlight was riding through the alleyways around Ben Thanh Market at night and seeing how people were spending their warm Monday evening.

### 2. Exploring the Cu Chi Tunnels

A must-visit destination in HCMC is the Cu Chi Tunnels, a historical site that offers a profound glimpse into Vietnam's war-torn past. I delved into the intricate underground network used by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, gaining a deeper appreciation for the resilience and resourcefulness of the Vietnamese people. To reach these tunnels, it was about a 45 minute coach ride (traffic allowing) from where I was staying in District 3. I would place this a must-do for first-time visitors to the city.

### 3. Try out a street food tour in Saigon

For a gastronomic adventure, embark on a street food tour in Saigon. I indulged my taste buds in the myriad of flavors that the local stalls have to offer, providing a delicious and authentic taste of Vietnamese cuisine. Don't miss out on the chance to savor the iconic Pho at my personal favourite spot during the visit, He Thong Bun Bo Hue, where the aromatic broth and flavorful noodles created a culinary experience to remember.

### 4. Visit Bui Vien, an insane walking street of nightlife

When the sun sets in HCMC, head to Bui Vien, a lively street in District 1 renowned for its vibrant nightlife. Dive into the energetic atmosphere filled with bars, clubs, and street performers, making it an ideal location to unwind and soak in the city's after-dark charm.

### 5. Want to stay near the centre of the action, but want a quiter place to reset at night? Try staying in District 3 (Quận 3 Hồ Chí Minh)

District 1 (considered HCMC's most busiest district) is the commercial and financial hub of the city, featuring a mix of modern skyscrapers, historic French colonial buildings, bustling markets, and a plethora of shops, restaurants, and nightlife venues. For a more tranquil stay, opt for District 3 over District 1.

District 3 offers a quieter experience while still allowing convenient access to the city's main attractions. Enjoy the best of both worlds by immersing yourself in the local culture during the day and returning to a peaceful retreat at night in District 3. It was about 10-15 minute ride to get back to District 1.

### What's next for me in Vietnam?

As much I really enjoyed my experience in Saigon, in the future, I hope to visit the north (Hanoi, Ha Long Bay) and work my way through the central (Hội An) back down South (Nha Trang, Bình Thuận) as Vietnam has much more to offer for it's visitors.
