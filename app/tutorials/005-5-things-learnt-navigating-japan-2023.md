Japan finally opened without stringent COVID restrictions earlier this year, and after returning to the country for the second time in April, it still reigns as one of my favourite destinations on the _planet_.

It is a country that seamlessly blends traditional charm with cutting-edge technology. Its unique culture, stunning landscapes, and vibrant cities make it a popular destination for travellers from around the world. To ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience while exploring Japan, it's important to keep in mind a few key tips. In this post, I'll highlight five essential pointers that I learnt that will help you make the most of your time in Japan.

### 1. Cash is King

When it comes to financial transactions, Japan is still predominantly a cash-based society. While credit cards are accepted at major hotels, department stores, and some restaurants, it's always a good idea to carry cash with you. Many smaller establishments, street vendors, and local shops may only accept cash. Additionally, some places, especially in rural areas, may not have ATMs readily available. 

> Tip: When I did eventually find an ATM, 7 Eleven stores seemed to offer a generous GBP/JPY to exchange rate compared to the other vendors that I came across. Also, the keypad experience on their ATMs is pure aesthetic heaven ðŸ˜Œ.

Having some yen on hand will ensure you can conveniently make purchases or pay for services wherever you go!

### 2. Use a Pasmo or Suica Card (IC Card) for Travel

Public transportation in Japan is renowned for its efficiency and punctuality. To make your travel experience even smoother, consider getting a Pasmo or Suica card. These IC (Integrated Circuit, in case you were wondering) rechargeable smart cards can be used on trains, subways, buses, and even some taxis in major cities across the country. Simply touch the card to the designated reader at the ticket gates or on buses, and the fare will be automatically deducted. This eliminates the hassle of buying individual tickets for each journey and saves you time. Those paper passes do add up inside a pocket ðŸ˜…! 

> Tip: Planning to leave Japan, but still have a leftover amount in your travel card? You can get your IC card deposit back! Usually the deposit (I paid 500 yen for a Pasmo card) can be yours again by visiting a supporting ticket office in a station. You can also get a refund at ticket offices in Haneda & Narita airport too.

### 3. Use an IC Card for More than Travel

As a big fan of keeping my pockets light (physically), I was glad to know that apart from transportation, Pasmo and Suica cards also have additional benefits. They can be used to make purchases at vending machines, convenience stores, and select shops (beat that, TfL!). This makes them a convenient alternative to cash for small transactions. Many vending machines, especially those selling drinks or snacks, accept these cards, so you can easily rehydrate or satisfy your hunger on the go. The cards can also be used for lockers at train stations, making it convenient to store your belongings while you explore (they have proven to be very handy).

### 4. Carry a Bag for Your Rubbish

One of the most striking aspects of Japan is its cleanliness. It's actually insane  how most of the streets, parks, and public spaces in Tokyo are remarkably clean with a metro population of 40,700,000 people! This is thanks to the country's strong emphasis on maintaining a tidy environment. To contribute to this culture of cleanliness, it's advisable to carry a small bag with you for your rubbish. Public trash bins can be hard to find, especially in rural areas or smaller towns. By keeping your trash with you until you find a suitable place to dispose of it, you help uphold Japan's pristine surroundings.

### 5. Trains Do Not Run 24 Hours

While Japan's transportation system is highly efficient, it's important to note that trains do not operate around the clock. In most cities, train services typically cease during the late evening and resume early in the morning. This means that if you plan on staying out late (especially for Shibuya & Shinjuku fans like me ðŸ‘€), you need to be mindful of the train schedules to ensure you can return to your accommodation. Alternatively, you can consider taking a taxi, but it's important to note that taxi fares in Japan can be relatively expensive.

### Conclusion

Japan offers an incredible travel experience, but being aware of certain aspects can enhance your trip. Carrying cash, using Pasmo or Suica cards for travel and small purchases, being mindful of your rubbish, and being aware of train schedules are essential tips that will help you navigate the country smoothly. By following these tips, you can focus on immersing yourself in Japan's rich culture, savouring its delectable cuisine, and creating memories that will last a lifetime.
